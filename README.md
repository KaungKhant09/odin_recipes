# odin_recipes
A place for my gandma's favorite recipes!

This project, Odin Recipes, is a basic recipe website built as part of learning HTML. It consists of a main index page with links to a few recipes. The primary purpose of this project is to practice and demonstrate HTML skills, with minimal emphasis on styling. Future iterations of this project will focus on adding CSS to enhance its visual appeal.

## Usage
To view the website, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You can navigate to different recipes by clicking on the provided links.
